# MusicAPI
 
This project allowed me to test and practice manipulating an API with a lot of music and details of it like artist, duration, key, etc., as well as understand possible errors that may occur in the deserialization process.

Among the features I applied in this project are the filtering and sorting of certain items with LINQ.

Finally, I created the structure to generate a JSON file of the items I manipulated.

To better describe its functionality, I started by importing the data from the API into my application, deserialized it so I could handle the files, and started some challenges, such as the following functions:

- Filter all the songs by key.
- Sort the list of songs from A to Z
- Filter all musical genres
- Group all the favorite songs in a JSON file and export it.
